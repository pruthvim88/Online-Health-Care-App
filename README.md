# Online-Health-Care-App
A proto type of online healthcare application to book doctor and diagnostic lab appointments and manage digital health records

We have built an online healthcare application to book doctor and diagnostic lab
appointments and manage digital health records. The application allows patients to search for the
doctors in their vicinity as per specialization. It allows patients to look at available slots and book an
appointment when required. The application also helps patients to digitally store all their medical
records and associated history in a digital health record.
Each location has a number of hospitals. Hospitals have many departments based on the
specialization: Dentist, Ophthalmologist, Dermatologist, Psychiatrist, Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT),
Gynaecologist, Neurologist, Urologist etc. Multiple doctors work at each hospital departments.
Patients book doctor’s appointment online. Patients can book diagnostic lab appointment. Patients
maintain a digital health record which can be accessed and updated by doctors and diagnostic lab
attendant. The digital health record contains the medical history of the patient including previous
diagnostic lab test results and previous doctor’s prescriptions. The application also has an online
forum where the patients can ask health related questions and doctors can give answers.
Patients can select location and search for the doctors in their vicinity. They can select
